# ANSH SHARMA

## Programming Language Used:
**Python 3**

## Description:
This repository contains the solutions to the **TANDEMLOOP Full Stack Developer Screening Test (Stage-1)**. The problems are solved using Python, and each solution is written in a separate file for clarity and modularity.

## Problem Breakdown:

---

### **Problem-1: Calculator using Class**
**File:** `Problem-1.py`

- A simple calculator built using object-oriented programming.
- Accepts two float values `a`, `b`, and a string `operation` (`add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`).
- Returns the computed result based on the type of operation.

---

### **Problem-2: Series Generation (Based on input 'a')**
**File:** `Problem-2.py`

- Generates a series of the first `a` **odd numbers** starting from 1.
- Input: Integer `a`
- Output: Comma-separated odd number series.

---

### **Problem-3: Modified Odd Series**
**File:** `Problem-3.py`

- Similar to Problem 2 but with logic: If input is even, series up to `a-1` odd numbers. If odd, up to `a` odd numbers.
- Input: Integer `a`
- Output: Conditional odd number series based on input.

---

### **Problem-4: Count Multiples in List**
**File:** `Problem-4.py`

- From a given list of integers, count how many elements are divisible by each number from 1 to 9.
- Output is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 9 and respective counts.
